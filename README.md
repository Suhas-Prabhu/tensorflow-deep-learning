Tensorflow is an end-to-end machine learning and deep learning framework developed and maintained by Google. It has a huge collection of models, libraries and tools that make data science and AI project development easier.

This repository contains my practice files and experimental codes on tensorflow,written during the time i was learning tensorflow [Tensorflow-deep-learning]() repository. Kindly go to the link refered for in-detail understanding and coding of tensorflow.
