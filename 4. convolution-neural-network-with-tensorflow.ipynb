A batch size of 32 is good for your health.There are many different batch sizes you could use but 32 has proven to be very effective in many different use cases and is often the default for many data preprocessing functions.\n        - The ImageDataGenerator class helps us prepare our images into batches as well as perform transformations on them as they get loaded into the model.You might've noticed the rescale parameter. This is one example of the transformations we're doing.\n- Create a model (start with a baseline)\n    - And it follows the typical CNN structure of:\n        \n      Input -> Conv + ReLU layers (non-linearities) -> Pooling layer -> Fully connected (dense layer) as Output\n    - Let's discuss some of the components of the Conv2D layer:\n      - The \"2D\" means our inputs are two dimensional (height and width), even though they have 3 colour channels, the convolutions are run on each channel invididually.\n      - filters - these are the number of \"feature extractors\" that will be moving over our images.\n      - kernel_size - the size of our filters, for example, a kernel_size of (3, 3) (or just 3) will mean each filter will have the size 3x3, meaning it will look at a space of 3x3 pixels each time. The smaller the kernel, the more fine-grained features it will extract.\n      - stride - the number of pixels a filter will move across as it covers the image. A stride of 1 means the filter moves across each pixel 1 by 1. A stride of 2 means it moves 2 pixels at a time.\n      - padding - this can be either 'same' or 'valid', 'same' adds zeros the to outside of the image so the resulting output of the convolutional layer is the same as the input, where as 'valid' (default) cuts off excess pixels where the filter doesn't fit (e.g. 224 pixels wide divided by a kernel size of 3 (224/3 = 74.6) means a single pixel will get cut off the end.\n   - Since we're working on a binary classification problem (pizza vs. steak), the loss function we're using is 'binary_crossentropy', if it was mult-iclass, we might use something like 'categorical_crossentropy'.\n   - Adam with all the default settings is our optimizer and our evaluation metric is accuracy.\n- Fit the model\n- Evaluate the model\n   - When a model's validation loss starts to increase, it's likely that it's overfitting the training dataset. This means, it's learning the patterns in the training dataset too well and thus its ability to generalize to unseen data will be diminished.\n- Adjust different parameters and improve model (try to beat your baseline)\n   - Fitting a machine learning model comes in 3 steps:\n       - Create a basline.\n       - Beat the baseline by overfitting a larger model.\n       - Reduce overfitting.\n   - And there are even a few more things we could try to further overfit our model:\n       - Increase the number of convolutional layers.\n       - Increase the number of convolutional filters.\n       - Add another dense layer to the output of our flattened layer.\n- Repeat until satisfied\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets build 2 models \n - A convnet with max pooling \n - a
